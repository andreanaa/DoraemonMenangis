2. Go to the project's root folder and open terminal
3. run the main.py file with python with this script (make sure you have python3 installed) :

```

note that start is a folder name at savefiles/ folder containing the csv files needed to run the app. When you create another save folder with the save command in the app (example : mysave1), you can open that by this command :

```
python main.py <your-savefile-name>
```

In this case :

```
python main.py mysave1
```

The file tree would be :
```
- root/
  - savefiles/
    - start/
    - mysave1/
```
For the commands, you can check at the specification above or type help at anytime to open the help menu
